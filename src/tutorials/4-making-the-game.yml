  - subtitle: How the game is going to work
    text: >-
      In the next tutorials we're going to take what we've done and make a simple game.<br>
      First we need to workout what we're going to do in it.<br>
      We'll have a cube that will start in a <b>random position</b> and then
      it will <b>fly towards the camera</b>. The player then needs to <b>look at</b>
      and <b>click on</b> the box to destroy it <b>before it hits us</b>.<br><br>
      To keep things simple <b>we've added a bit of code</b> that will tell the player
      they have <b>lost if they are hit by the box</b> and <b>that they have won if the box
      has disappeared</b>. Whenever you see <br><code>&#60;a-box <b>invader</b> ...&#62;&#60;/a-box&#62;</code>,
      that means we've added some code to help.
  - subtitle: Move the box towards the camera.
    instruction: >-
      Let's make the part of the game that makes the box <b>fly towards the camera</b>.<br>
      I've put the box a bit further away from the camera.
      Can you make one more animation that moves it closer?
      <b>Hint:</b> Copy and paste one of the other animations and then change it's attributes.<br>
      See what happens when the box hits you!

  - subtitle: Make some exciting different shapes.
    instruction: >-
      Here's all your code. I've made the box start in a random position each game.
      Try changing the box to a <code>ring</code>, <code>torus</code> or <code>dodecahedron</code>!<br>
