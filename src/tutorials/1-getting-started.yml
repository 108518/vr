      Let's begin with a simple 3D box.
      Can you work out how to change the colour of the box?
      Try changing it to orange.

      <a-sky color="#eee"></a-sky><a-camera user-height="0"></a-camera>
    code: |-
      <a-box position="0 0 -3" rotation="45 45 0" color="purple"></a-box>

      Great! You've just changed your first VR element.
      For a slightly harder challenge,
      see if you can work out how to move the box on the screen.<br>
      <b>Hint:</b> Change one number at a time to try to work out what each one does.<br>
      Also make sure you pick small numbers to change them by such as <code>1</code>.

  - subtitle: Rotating things around to get a better view.
    instruction: >-
      We'll do something a little more complicated now.
      Try to rotate the box to see it from different angles.
      What do each of the three numbers do?<br>
      <b>Hint:</b> They are measured in degrees.
